## About The Project

This Player _vs_ AI Battleship game was made as part of The Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript Path.

The main purpose of this project was to be an introduction and practice to Test Driven Development, as I had a test-first approach.

The code is made of separate and immutable components who interact with each other only through their public API.

The components are tested individually to assure that they are not tightly coupled.
